A Kubernetes cluster started when you began the scenario. Run the `kubectl get nodes` command to see if the nodes are in the *Ready* state:

`git clone https://github.com/elastic/opbeans-java.git`{{execute HOST1}}

blah blah blah

Edit the environment file and set your cloud ID, elastic password, and APM Secret:
`/root/course/environment`{{open}}

Source the environment variables:
`source /root/course/environment`{{execute HOST1}}
