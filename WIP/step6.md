Launch Kibana by clicking on the Kibana tab right next to the Guestbook tab at the top of your terminal.  If  you have made entries in the Guestbook you will see these in the Discover tab, and in the Dashboard [Filebeat Apache2] Access and Error Logs.  If you have not made entries in the Guestbook, go ahead and do so.  The Guestbook tab is right next to the Kibana tab at the top of the terminal.
