#### Launch Kibana 

Launch Kibana by clicking on the **Kibana** tab at the top of your terminal. If you made entries in the Guestbook earlier in the demo, you should be able to see these in the Kibana Discover app, and in the [Filebeat Apache2] Access and Error Logs dashboard. If you have not not yet made entries in the Guestbook, go ahead and do so now. The **Guestbook** tab is right next to the **Kibana** tab at the top of the terminal.
